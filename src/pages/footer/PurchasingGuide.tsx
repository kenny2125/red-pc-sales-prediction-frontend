                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> When buying a new computer or tech equipment, start by assessing your specific needs. Are you purchasing for basic home use like browsing the internet and light document editing, or do you need a more powerful system for gaming, video editing, or programming? Different uses require different hardware capabilities.
 
If you're a gamer, for instance, you'll need a system with a powerful GPU and fast refresh rates, whereas a graphic designer might prioritize color accuracy and screen quality. If you're working in an office environment, portability and battery life might take precedence. Keep in mind that determining your needs early will help you narrow down your options and avoid overspending on features you don’t really need.
</li>

Additionally, consider the overall cost of ownership. Some products may seem affordable upfront, but they might require costly upgrades or additional peripherals down the line. It's wise to think ahead and anticipate future needs, such as buying additional storage, software, or even warranties that could extend the lifespan of your device.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. SSDs are ideal if speed and performance are important to you, whereas HDDs are better suited for bulk storage at a lower price. When choosing your specifications, remember that it’s often easier to upgrade certain components later, such as RAM or storage, so it's not always necessary to max out your configuration from the start.</li>
